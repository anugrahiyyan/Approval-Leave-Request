## üöÄ How to Run This Project

Follow the steps below to set everything up:

1. **Create a new Google Sheet**.
2. **Rename the first sheet** to `Requests`  
   > This sheet will serve as the backend for processing requests.
3. **(Optional)** Create additional sheets for dashboards or analytics ‚Äî feel free to customize them to fit your needs.
4. **Open the Apps Script editor**  
   Go to `Extensions` ‚Üí `Apps Script`.
5. **Add all script files except `index.html`** to your Apps Script project.
6. **Deploy your project** using the Apps Script deployment options.

## ‚ùì Why is `index.html` not included in Apps Script?

- The `index.html` file is used **only for the landing page**, hosted separately.
- This approach helps ensure proper **domain ownership verification** for Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- Once verified, your GCP app can be associated securely with your custom domain.
- You can read more about GCP domain verification via [Google‚Äôs documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/9110914).
